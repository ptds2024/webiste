### Laptops
Please consider bringing a laptop with you to class each week if you have one available. We encourage collaborative work among students, and ideally, we aim to have at least one laptop for every 2 to 3 students. Given that both homework assignments and the project involve team efforts, we recommend partnering with classmates who possess a laptop.

In the event that you intend to purchase a laptop, please keep in mind that students from Swiss Universities can benefit from preferential pricing through the [Neptun Projekt](https://www.projektneptun.ch/) or [EPFL's Poseidon](https://poseidon.epfl.ch/).

You do not need to buy a laptop if you do not possess one.

### OS
It is possible to follow this class using Mac OS, Windows and Linux. Yes, Linux. Why not Linux?
See <https://itsfoss.com/linux-better-than-windows/>,  <https://www.profolus.com/topics/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-macos/> and <http://jobsinthefuture.com/index.php/2018/03/02/best-operating-system-os-for-data-science/>.

### Textbooks
This class is based on the online textbook:

- **Required**: [An Introduction to Statistical Programming Methods with R](http://r.smac-group.com)

This document is under development and it is therefore preferable to always access the text online to be sure you are using the most up-to-date version. Due to its current development, you may encounter errors ranging from broken code to typos or poorly explained topics. If you do, please let us know! Simply add an issue to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SMAC-Group/ds/issues) used for this document and we will make the changes as soon as possible. In addition, if you know RMarkdown and are familiar with GitHub, make a pull request and fix an issue yourself, otherwise, if you're not familiar with these tools, they will be explained later on in the book itself.

The textbooks below are also recommended and are legally available online for free. The following texts will be heavily referenced:

- **Recommended**: [Advanced R Programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham
- **Recommended**: [R Packages Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham
- **Recommended**: [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) by W. N. Venables, D. M. Smith, and the R Core Team
- **Recommended**: [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas and Alison Presmanes Hill
- **Recommended**: [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) by Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund
- **Recommended**: [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) by Hadley Wickham
- **Recommended**: [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) by Jennifer Bryan

The following textbooks are helpful, but not necessary to succeed in the course:

- **Supplemental**: [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (2nd Edition - GitHub Only)](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book) by Hadley Wickham
- **Supplemental**: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
- **Supplemental**: [The R Inferno](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf) by Patrick Burns
- **Supplemental**: [R Programming for Data Science](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/) by Roger D. Peng
- **Supplemental**: [Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/book/) by Dirk Eddelbuettel
- **Supplemental**: [Engineering Production-Grade Shiny Apps](https://engineering-shiny.org/) by Colin Fay, SÃ©bastien Rochette, Vincent Guyader, Cervan Girard

We regrouped more references by category in the [resources page]({{<relref "resources/_index.md">}}).

### Software
All the software we will be using are free for acamedic activities. The course will use and present the [R statistical computing language](https://www.r-project.org/) as well as different parts of C++ through [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/). The integrated developer environment that we will use to explore R is [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) made by [RStudio Inc](https://www.rstudio.com/).
See <https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/08/17/r-and-rstudio-the-interoperability-environment-for-data-analytics> for why it would be interesting as data scientist to use R/RStudio.
