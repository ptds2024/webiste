This class is intended to introduce to the students a wide range of programming tools using the `R` language. Tentative list of topics that will be discussed in this class are listed below:

- **Reproducible research:** [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) and [rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- **Version control:** [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- **Introduction to programming:** Data structures, logical operators, control structures and functions
- **Visualizations:** Exploratory data analysis with Base R and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
- **R packages:** Construction of R-packages using [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/vignettes/dependencies.html), [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/roxygen2.html) and
  [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html)
- **Communication:** webiste creation via [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), Web application via [shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
- **Web scraping:** Automatic extraction of data from websites using [SelectorGadget](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html), [rvest](https://blog.rstudio.com/2014/11/24/rvest-easy-web-scraping-with-r/) and [quantmod](https://www.quantmod.com/), regular expression
- **High performance computing:** R and C++ integration via [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org/), parallel computing.

We don't assume any prior IT background from our students; however, we do expect a strong desire to acquire valuable and hands-on programming skills.

This course is complementary to the [Data Science in Business Analytics](https://www.unil.ch/hec/home/menuinst/masters/management/cours-et-horaires.html?url=/web/syllabus/2868) class. We highly recommend that students follow this class prior to PTDS.
