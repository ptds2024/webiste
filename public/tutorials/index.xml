Hadley Wickham  Introduction A language is a tool that allows human beings to interact and communicate with each other. The clearer we express ourselves, the better an idea is transferred from our mind to the other. The same applies to programming languages: concise, clear and consistent codes are easier to read and/or edit.</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety. Jenny Bryan  Introduction In this tutorial we will learn key aspects of making a good research project:
 reproducible portable self-contained  In data science context, reproducibility means that the whole analysis can be recreated (or repeated) from the fresh start and raw data and get exactly the same results.</description>

      <description>The aim of this tutorial is to show how to write your own program for estimating a logistic regression. Note that the goal is purely educational since the logistic regression has already solid implementations in R.
Introduction Logistic regression is one of most famous tool to model binary data. It is often introduced in under-graduate class of statistics and machine learning.
For illustration, we fit a logistic regression on the titanic dataset.</description>
