      <description>1. Installing R and RStudio 1.1 Installing R We start with installing the latest version of R (4.0.2 as of August 14, 2020). R itself is similar to an engine and chassis of a car, that is a bare minimum so that you can start driving. You need to follow steps below:
 Visit https://cran.r-project.org and click on &amp;ldquo;Download R for &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, where &amp;hellip; coresponds to your operating system. Depending on the operating system:  For Mac: download &amp;ldquo;R-4.</description>

      <description>Good coding style is like using correct punctuation. You can manage without it, but it sure makes things easier to read. Hadley Wickham  Introduction A language is a tool that allows human beings to interact and communicate with each other. The clearer we express ourselves, the better an idea is transferred from our mind to the other. The same applies to programming languages: concise, clear and consistent codes are easier to read and/or edit.</description>

      <description>Itâ€™s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety. Jenny Bryan  Introduction In this tutorial we will learn key aspects of making a good research project:
 reproducible portable self-contained  In data science context, reproducibility means that the whole analysis can be recreated (or repeated) from the fresh start and raw data and get exactly the same results.</description>

      <description>Homework generously provided by the Data Science in Business Analytics class.
This homework is optional and is not graded.
 In this optional tutorial you will get an overview of the basic programming concepts in R and main data types. Just enough to get you up and running essential R code. However, for true &amp;ldquo;beginners&amp;rdquo;, we highly recommend going through Advanced R - Chapter &amp;lsquo;Foundations&amp;rsquo; from which the content of this assignment is mainly (mostly) inspired by.</description>

      <description>The aim of this tutorial is to show how to write your own program for estimating a logistic regression. Note that the goal is purely educational since the logistic regression has already solid implementations in R.
Introduction Logistic regression is one of most famous tool to model binary data. It is often introduced in under-graduate class of statistics and machine learning.
For illustration, we fit a logistic regression on the titanic dataset.</description>

      <description>Slack We will be using Slack for class-related discussion and questions, to help you benefit from each otherâ€™s questions and the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors. Questions can be posted to the entire class (for content-related questions). I encourage you to ask questions if you are struggling to understand a concept, and to answer your classmatesâ€™ questions when you can.
Email Most matters, public or private, should be addresssed through Slack.</description>

      <description>Laptops Bring a laptop to the class every week if you have one. We encourage students to work collaboratively, so we would like to have at least one laptop for every 2 or 3 students. Since the homeworks and the project are the work of a team, we encourage you to team-up with students that possess a laptop. In the case you plan to buy a laptop, remember that the students from Swiss Universities have preferential prices via the Neptun Projekt or the EPFL&amp;rsquo;s Poseidon.</description>
